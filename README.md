# Knight, Dragons, Princess
## Description
"Knight, Dragons, Princess" is a plataformer video game I developed for my Introduction to Computer Science class at NYU Abu Dhabi with my classmate Rustem Khassanov. The game is written in Python and utilizes Processing conventions to handle its graphical user interface. 

## The Game
The game follows a brave knight who is tasked with finding a lost princess. In order to find the princess the knight must traverse a dark system of caves with the help of a flashlight equipped with limited battery. 

The game is inspired by [Grotto](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596294350/), a game hosted on Scratch developed by "MrZorx75". 

The game is enhanced with a series of special features such as:

**Special Items** — Designed to enhance the player's features.
- "Immunity Bubble" — Temporarily provides immunity to the player.
- "Jumping Boots" — Temporarily allows the player to jump higher than normally.
- "Fancy Boots" —  Temporarily allows the player to jump in the air.
- "Torch" — The player holds a torch at all times. The torch is initialized with a certain level of battery that the player must conserve and use wisely. The torch is used to temporarily illuminate the way ahead. 
- "Torch Batteries" — Renews the torch's battery.
- "Sword" — Temporarily grants the player the ability to kill enemies (dragons) by running into them.

**Hazardous Items** — Obstacles to the player.
- "Dragon Eggs" — If the player comes into contact with a dragon egg, a dragon spawns and kills the player.
- "Lava" — If the player falls into a pit of lava they are instantly killed.

**Enemies** — Moving obstacles.
- "Dragons" - Dragons are the main enemies of the game. Dragons move and coming into contact with them is deadly.

**Levels** — Individual tunnel systems the player has to navigate.
- "Caves" — The character may hide in caves to avoid coming into contact with dragons while awaiting their departure.

**Other Features** —
- "Light Circle" — As in Grotto, the game that inspired KDP, the player may only see their character's immediate sorroundings.

Most of the game's assets were designed by Levith to provide a cohesive look to the game.
