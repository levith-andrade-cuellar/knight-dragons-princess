## Description
"Knight, Dragons, Princess" is a plataformer video game we developed for our Introduction to Computer Science class. The game is written in Python and utilizes Processing conventions to handle its graphical user interface. 

## The Game
The game follows a brave knight who is tasked with finding a lost princess. In order to find the princess the knight must traverse a dark system of caves with the help of a flashlight equipped with limited battery. 

The game is inspired by [Grotto](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596294350/), a game hosted on Scratch developed by "MrZorx75". 

Special features include: 

**Special Items** — Designed to enhance the player's features.
- "Immunity Bubble" — Temporarily provides immunity to the player.
- "Jumping Boots" — Temporarily allows the player to jump higher than they normally do.
- "Fancy Boots" —  Temporarily allows the player to jump in the air.
- "Torch" — The player holds a torch at all times. The torch is initialized with a certain level of battery that the player must conserve and use wisely. The torch is used to temporarily illuminate the way ahead. 
- "Torch Batteries" — Renews the torch's battery.
- "Sword" — Temporarily grants the player the ability to kill enemies (dragons) by running into them.

**Hazardous Items** — Obstacles to the player.
- "Dragon Eggs" — If the player comes into contact with a dragon egg, a dragon spawns and kills the player.
- "Lava" — Coming into contact with lava kills the player.

**Enemies** — Moving obstacles.
- "Dragons" - Dragons are the main enemies of the game. Coming into contact with them kills the plater.

**Levels** — Individual tunnel systems the player has to navigate.
- "Caves" — The character may hide in caves to avoid coming into contact with dragons while awaiting their departure.

**Other Features** —
- "Light Circle" — As in Grotto, the game that inspired KDP, the player may only see their character's immediate sorroundings.

Most of the game's assets were designed by Levith to provide a cohesive look to the game.
